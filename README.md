# Mixing Calculator

A simple tool designed to test various mixing combinations and provide the best recipes for the game *Schedule 1*. This program automates the process of finding optimal mixtures by evaluating multiple possibilities and returning the most effective results.

## Features
- Tests a wide range of mixing combinations.
- Calculates and ranks recipes based on efficiency or predefined criteria.
- Outputs detailed recipes for use in *Schedule 1*.

## Disclaimer
Please note that this Mixing Calculator does not always guarantee the absolute best mixture. It utilizes reinforcement learning to explore and optimize combinations, which means results are based on probabilistic exploration rather than exhaustive computation. While it aims to provide highly effective recipes, the outcome may vary depending on the parameters and constraints provided.
